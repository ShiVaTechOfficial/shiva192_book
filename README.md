Shando's legendary ShiVa Book for ShiVa 1.8 to 1.9.2

This book is the definite beginner's guide on the old ShiVa 1.x series of editors, back when ShiVa was developed by StoneTrip. It was written by community member Shando69 and graciously donated to the community for free, so everyone can enjoy and learn from it.

## A word from the author

G’day from Australia,

My book (it’s the first time I’ve written a book, so please be kind in your comments and criticisms) is based on v1.7 of ShiVa, and much of the code was written using the PLE version, so you should all be able to at least try it out!

The book is split into 17 Chapters, which I hope give a good introduction to ShiVa:

The first couple of Chapters give a brief overview of ShiVa and 3D programming in general, then, in Chapter 3, I move on to a more in-depth look at the various ShiVa modules. Chapters 4 & 5 show you how to build a couple of simple first applications and, in Chapter 6, I show you how to use PolyTrails and Particle Systems. Chapter 7 is all about SoundBanks, and Chapter 8 goes deep into the Material Editor. Chapter 9 covers the HUD, and Chapters 10 & 11 explain how to use Attributes and Ambience. Next I explain Animation and, in Chapter 13, Pathfinding. Chapter 14 is a quick intro to XML use in ShiVa, and Chapter 15 introduces the HLDL Framework. Chapter 16 explains how to create Terrains, and the final Chapter shows how I built my “Dino Hunter” game. In all of the Chapters, I’ve tried to use standard StoneTrip demos to explain part of what the Chapter’s about.

I hope this book helps you to understand ShiVa and 3D programming. Remember that the developer’s forum and the internet are your friends for pretty much anything to do with ShiVa and the 3D world. I have spent many hours searching the internet for code (and advice), and then converting it from one language to another (it always seemed to be in a language (Java, C#, C++ etc.) other than the one I wanted!), so be prepared for some hard work! You can pretty much bet that a lot of what you want to do has already been done by someone, somewhere.
